**Custom low-code & AI-powered business applications for Canadian SMBs.**

Many small and mid-size businesses outgrow their SaaS tools — but can’t justify the cost of traditional custom development.  
We help you bridge that gap.

## 🚀 What we do

We build **secure, scalable web applications** using a modern low-code platform (Dazzm) combined with custom code where needed:

- Workflow automation & internal tools  
- Customer/partner portals  
- Data dashboards & reporting  
- Integrations (API, AWS, RAG/LLM)  
- Full web applications from prototype to production  
- Migration from spreadsheets/SaaS limits to custom software  

Our focus: **reduce development cost & time-to-value**, without sacrificing quality.
